    "### Exercise: Support LLM Dispatcher\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Build an agent that uses an LLM to route a user to one of three departments: **Technical**, **Billing**, or **Legal**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. The Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The State:** Define a simple `TypedDict` that holds the `user_input` and a `category`. (No reducers or message lists needed yet!)\n",
    "* **The LLM Node:** Create a function where you pass the user's input to an LLM with a **System Prompt**.\n",
    "* *The Instruction:* \"Look at the user's request. Output exactly one word: 'technical', 'billing', or 'legal'.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. The Three Specialist Nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create three separate functions.\n",
    "* Each function should print a unique message (e.g., \"Connecting to a lawyer...\" or \"Opening a support ticket...\").\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. The Routing Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use a **Conditional Edge**.\n",
    "* This edge should look at the `category` string the LLM produced and decide which of the three specialist nodes to visit next.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Test your agent\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input A:** \"I need to change my credit card on file.\" (Works great!)\n",
    "2. **Input B:** \"I'm having a problem with my thing.\" (**Fails!**)\n",
    "\n",
    "Why does it fail?"
