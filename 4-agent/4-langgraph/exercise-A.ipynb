    "## The Exercise: The Smart Researcher\n",
    "- This exercise focuses on building a basic **ReAct (Reasoning and Acting)** pattern. \n",
    "- In this scenario, you will create a graph that can either:\n",
    "  - answer a user's question directly,  or \n",
    "  - decide to use a tool (like a search engine or calculator) if it needs more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your task is to build a stateful graph that simulates a conversation between an AI agent and a set of tools. \n",
    "- The agent should look at the user's prompt and determine if it has the answer or if it needs to \"call out\" for help.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Graph Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The Agent Node:** This node receives the current state (the list of messages), calls the LLM, and returns the updated state.\n",
    "2. **The Decision (Conditional Edge):** After the Agent Node runs, the graph must evaluate the LLM's output.\n",
    "* If the LLM generated **tool calls**, the graph should route to the **Tools Node**.\n",
    "* If the LLM generated a **final response** (plain text), the graph should route to the **End**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The Tools Node:** This node executes the requested tools and passes the results back to the **Agent Node** so it can synthesize a final answer.\n",

    "#### Important Classes and Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this exercise, you should utilize the following components from the `langgraph` and `langchain` libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Component Type | Name to Use | Purpose |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| **State Definition** | `TypedDict` / `Annotated` | To define the schema (usually a list of messages). |\n",
    "| **Graph Container** | `StateGraph` | The main class used to initialize the graph structure. |\n",
    "| **Edge Logic** | `add_conditional_edges` | The method that routes the flow based on a function's output. |\n",
    "| **Pre-built Tool Node** | `ToolNode` | A helper class that automatically executes tools. |\n",
    "| **Logic Gate** | `tools_condition` | A built-in LangGraph function that checks for tool calls. |\n",
    "| **Model Binding** | `.bind_tools()` | A method to tell the LLM which tools are available. |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Your Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Construct the graph so that it can handle a query like *\"What is the weather in Tokyo?\"* by looping through a weather tool, but can also handle *\"Hello!\"* by ending immediately after the first node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you like me to provide a list of the specific imports you'll need to get started?"
