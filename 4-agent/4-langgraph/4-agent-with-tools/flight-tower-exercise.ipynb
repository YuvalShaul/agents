    "\n",
    "You are the operator of a coastal airfield. Pilots call in with their airplane size, but they don't know the local weather. You have an automated **Anemometer (Wind Tool)** that tells you if the crosswinds are \"Safe\" or \"Dangerous.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to guide the pilot to the correct runway or tell them to stay in a holding pattern if information is missing.\n",

    "- Use a wind measure tools (Anemometer)\n",
    "- Decide what nodes you want to include in your graph\n",
    "- Logic:\n",
    "    - If the pilot **hasn't** specified their airplane size (Large or Small), the agent must ask them to clarify.\n",
    "    - If the size is known, the agent must call the **Wind Tool**.\n",
    "    - Once it has both the **Size** and the **Wind Power**, it constructs an output specifying the destination.\n",
    "    - Runway 1: Destination for all **Large** planes, or any plane if wind is **High**.\n",
    "    - Runway 2: Destination for **Large** planes only if wind is **Low**.\n",
    "    - Runway 3: Destination for **Small** planes only if wind is **Low**.\n",
    "    - Back to Pilot: If the airplane size was missing.\n",
    "    - Tool Node: If the wind data is missing.\n",
