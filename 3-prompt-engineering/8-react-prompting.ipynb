    "## ReAct pattern\n",
    "In the world of Generative AI, the React (Reasoning and Acting) pattern is a framework that allows LLMs to solve complex tasks by combining \"chain-of-thought\" reasoning with real-world actions (like searching the web or running code).\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of just guessing an answer, the model follows a structured loop: Think, Act, Observe.\n",
    "\n",
    "link:\n",
    "[ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629)\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the ReAct Loop Works\n",
    "The pattern typically follows a repeating cycle until the model reaches a final conclusion.  \n",
    "It helps reduce hallucinations because the model must ground its reasoning in actual data retrieved from its \"actions.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pattern:\n",
    "- Thought: The model describes what it needs to do and why.\n",
    "- Action: The model selects a specific tool to use (e.g., a Google Search or a Calculator).\n",
    "- Observation: The model \"reads\" the result of that action.\n",
    "- Repeat: Based on the observation, the model starts a new \"Thought\" process until the task is complete."

    "#### Example 1\n",
    "**Prompt:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "You are an assistant that solves complex problems using a \"Reason + Act\" (ReAct) cycle. \n",
    "From now on, for every request, you must follow this structured format:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. THOUGHT: Describe your reasoning about the current situation and what your next step should be.\n",
    "2. ACTION: Identify the specific tool to use. Format this as Action: [tool_name] with [input].\n",
    "3. OBSERVATION: (This will be provided to you after the action is taken).\n",
    "4. REPEAT: Continue the cycle until you have enough information.\n",
    "5. FINAL ANSWER: Provide the final conclusion to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "AVAILABLE TOOLS:\n",
    "- search_web: Use this for current events or factual data.\n",
    "- calculator: Use this for any math or age calculations.\n",
    "- internal_database: Use this to look up company-specific documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rules:\n",
    "- Never skip the THOUGHT step.\n",
    "- Only perform ONE action at a time.\n",
    "- If the observation provides insufficient data, refine your THOUGHT and try again.\n",
