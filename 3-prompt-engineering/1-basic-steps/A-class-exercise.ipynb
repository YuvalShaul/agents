    "### Exercise: Implementing OpenAI Chat Completions\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective: To interface directly with the OpenAI API to send a series of structured messages and handle the resulting response object.\n",
    "Get help by looking at [this example](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/main/examples/demo.py)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Task 1: Client Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "- Establish a connection to the OpenAI service. \n",
    "- You will need to instantiate a central controller that manages your API key and base configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Class to use: `OpenAI`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Task 2: Defining the Message Array\n",
    "\n",
    "- OpenAI processes conversations as a list of dictionaries. \n",
    "- Each dictionary represents a message with a specific role. \n",
    "- Prepare a list containing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. System Role: A message that sets the behavior of the assistant (e.g., \"You are a concise technical writer\").\n",
    "2. User Role: The specific prompt or question from the human.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Roles to use: `\"system\"`, `\"user\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Task 3: Creating the Completion\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the client to send your message list to the model. \n",
    "- You must specify which brain (model) you are using and any sampling parameters.\n",
    "- Method to call: `client.chat.completions.create()`\n",
    "- Required Arguments: `model` (e.g., `\"gpt-4o\"` or `\"gpt-3.5-turbo\"`), `messages`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Task 4: Navigating the Response Object\n",
    "\n",
    "The API returns a complex nested object. You must navigate through the \"choices\" to find the actual text generated by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Access the first element of the **choices** list.\n",
    "2. Retrieve the **message** object from that choice.\n",
    "3. Extract the string **content**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Attributes to access:** `.choices[0].message.content`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Task 5: (optional) Handling Multi-turn Dialogue\n",
    "\n",
    "- To continue a conversation, you must manually append the model's last response back into your list before adding a new user message.\n",
    "- Role to use for the model's previous output: `\"assistant\"`\n",
    "\n"
