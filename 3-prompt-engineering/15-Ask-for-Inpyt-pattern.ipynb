    "## The Ask For Input pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Ask for Input\" prompt pattern is a fundamental technique in prompt engineering designed to prevent the AI from generating a complete response prematurely. Instead of guessing your requirements or providing a generic answer, the AI is instructed to wait and ask you for specific information first.\n",
    "\n",
    "It transforms the interaction from a monologue (where the AI guesses) into a dialogue (where the AI gathers requirements).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "In a standard prompt, you give instructions and hope for the best.  \n",
    "In the \"Ask for Input\" pattern, you explicitly tell the AI to pause.  \n",
    "The structure usually follows these steps:\n",
    "- Define the Goal: Tell the AI what you ultimately want to achieve.\n",
    "- Declare the Constraint: Tell the AI not to generate the final result yet.\n",
    "- Specify the Information Needed: List the categories of data you want it to collect from you.\n",
    "- Initiate the Questioning: Direct the AI to start by asking the first question.\n",
    "\n",

    "| Feature | Standard Prompting  | \"Ask for Input\" Pattern | \n",
    "| Output Type | Direct answer/output | Guided questionnaire | \n",
    "| Accuracy | Varies (often contains \"hallucinations\" or assumptions)| High (grounded in specific user data)\n",
    "| Effort | Low initial effort, high editing effort | Higher initial setup, low editing effort | \n",

    "**Prompt:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "I want you to act as a professional copywriter. I want you to write a LinkedIn bio for me, but I do not want you to write it yet.\n",
    "Before you begin, you must ask me a series of questions to understand my background, my target audience, and my tone of voice. Ask me one question at a time. Once you have enough information, tell me you are ready to write the bio.\n",
