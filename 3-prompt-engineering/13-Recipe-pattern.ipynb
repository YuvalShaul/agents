    "## The Recipe pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "The Recipe Prompt Pattern is a structural technique used to guide an AI through a complex task by breaking it down into a predefined set of \"ingredients\" (inputs) and \"instructions\" (steps).\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it as providing a template where the AI knows exactly what information to look for and what sequence of actions to perform to reach a specific \"dish\" or outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Core Components\n",
    "\n",
    "A well-structured recipe prompt usually follows this anatomy:  \n",
    "|  Component  | Description |  Example |\n",
    "| The Goal    | A clear statement of what the final output should be. | \"Generate a 500-word blog post.\"|\n",
    "| Ingredients | The specific data points or variables the AI must use.| \"Topic, Target Audience, Tone, Keywords.\"|\n",
    "| The Process | A step-by-step sequence of operations.  | \"1. Outline, 2. Draft, 3. Review for SEO.\"|\n",
    "| Constraints | The \"dos and don'ts\" or formatting rules. | \"No passive voice; use Markdown headings.\"|\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use This Pattern?\n",
    "Using a recipe pattern moves you away from \"hoping\" the AI gets it right and toward repeatable excellence.\n",
    "- Consistency: You get the same style and quality of output every time you swap the ingredients.\n",
    "- Modularity: You can easily update one \"step\" in the process without rewriting the entire prompt.\n",
    "- Error Reduction: By defining the ingredients upfront, the AI is less likely to hallucinate or skip crucial details."

    "#### Example 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "I would like to  be a sculpture.  \n",
    "I know that I need to perform steps like learning the profession and open my workshop.  \n",
    "Provide a complete sequence of steps for me. Fill in any missing steps.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Response:**\n",
    "Becoming a sculptor is a deeply rewarding journey that blends technical mastery with creative vision. Since you are looking for a complete sequence of steps to go from a beginner to a professional with your own workshop, here is a structured roadmap.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Education and Skill Acquisition\n",
    "\n",
    "Before opening a shop, you must master the physics of your chosen medium.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Choose Your Medium:** Decide whether you want to work with stone, wood, metal (welding/casting), or clay/ceramics. Each requires vastly different tools.\n",
    "* **Formal or Informal Training:** * **Academic:** A Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) provides a broad foundation and networking.\n",
    "* **Apprenticeship:** Finding a master sculptor to study under is the traditional way to learn specialized techniques like bronze casting or stone carving.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Study Anatomy:** Even for abstract work, understanding the skeletal and muscular structure of humans and animals is essential for creating \"weight\" and balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Developing a Portfolio\n",
    "\n",
    "You need a body of work to prove your capability to clients, galleries, and lenders.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Experimentation:** Spend time finding your \"voice.\" Are you a minimalist, a realist, or a conceptual artist?\n",
    "* **Documentation:** Invest in high-quality photography. Sculpture is 3D; you need photos from multiple angles with professional lighting to represent the work accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Business and Legal Foundations\n",
    "\n",
    "Transitioning from \"artist\" to \"professional sculptor\" requires a shift in mindset toward business management.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Step | Action Item | Why it Matters |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| **Business Plan** | Define your niche and pricing. | Ensures your workshop is financially sustainable. |\n",
    "| **Legal Structure** | Register as a Sole Proprietor or LLC. | Protects your personal assets and handles taxes. |\n",
    "| **Insurance** | Get \"Artist's Insurance.\" | Covers equipment theft and liability if a heavy piece injures someone. |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Setting Up the Workshop (The Studio)\n",
    "\n",
    "Sculpture is a heavy industry. Your workspace needs more than just a desk.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Ventilation and Safety:** Many sculpting processes involve dust, fumes, or heat. Proper HVAC and PPE (masks, goggles) are non-negotiable.\n",
    "* **Load Bearing:** Sculptures are heavy. Ensure your floor can support the weight of stone or large metal stocks.\n",
    "* **Specialized Equipment:** * **Subtractive:** Chisels, hammers, angle grinders, pneumatic tools.\n",
    "* **Additive:** Kilns, welding machines, casting crucibles, armatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Marketing and Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the workshop is running, you need to find homes for your pieces.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The \"Call for Entry\":** Apply to juried shows and competitions to build your resume.\n",
    "* **Gallery Representation:** Approach galleries that fit your style to handle sales on your behalf.\n",
    "* **Public Commissions:** Look for \"Percent for Art\" programs where cities dedicate a portion of construction budgets to public sculpture.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Sustainable Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Maintenance:** Learn how to preserve and clean your finished works so they last for centuries.\n",
    "* **Networking:** Join organizations like the **International Sculpture Center** to stay updated on grants and exhibitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you like me to create a specific list of essential tools based on a medium you are interested in, such as stone carving or metal welding?"

    "Format of the Recipe Pattern\n",
