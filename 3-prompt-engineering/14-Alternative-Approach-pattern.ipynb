    "## The Alternative Approaches pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "The Alternative Approaches pattern is a structural communication and problem-solving strategy used to present multiple solutions to a single problem.  \n",
    "Rather than advocating for a \"one size fits all\" answer, it focuses on evaluating different methods based on specific constraints, trade-offs, and contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In software engineering, this is often referred to as the Strategy Pattern, while in business and design, it is a framework for Option Analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prompt Structure\n",
    "To get the most out of an AI when using the Alternative Approaches pattern, your prompt should explicitly ask for a comparison of different methods, a breakdown of trade-offs, and a specific recommendation based on a context you provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Components of the Pattern\n",
    "To use this pattern effectively, you typically break down the presentation into three distinct layers:\n",
    "| Component | Purpose |\n",
    "| The Context | Defines the problem statement and the goals that must be met.|\n",
    "| The Candidates | A curated list of 2–4 distinct methods to solve the problem.|\n",
    "| The Trade-off Matrix | A comparison of pros, cons, costs, and risks for each candidate.|\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use It?\n",
    "The primary goal of the Alternative Approaches pattern is to avoid \"The Golden Hammer\" bias—the tendency to use the same tool for every problem.\n",
    "- Objective Decision Making: It shifts the conversation from \"What do I like?\" to \"What fits the constraints?\"\n",
    "- Risk Mitigation: By exploring alternatives, you often uncover hidden pitfalls in your primary choice.\n",
    "- Stakeholder Buy-in: Showing that you have considered multiple paths builds trust and demonstrates due diligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Implementation: The Comparison Matrix\n",
    "When applying this pattern, a comparison table is the most effective way to visualize the \"Alt\" paths.  \n",
    "If you were choosing a data storage method, for example:  \n",
    "**Case Study: Choosing a Database**\n",
    "| Approach | Best For | Pros | Cons | \n",
    "|Relational (SQL) | Structured data, Finance | Data integrity, ACID compliance  | Harder to scale horizontally|\n",
    "| Document (NoSQL) | Unstructured data, CMS | Flexible schema, High speed | Potential for data duplication|\n",
    "| In-Memory (Redis) | Real-time analytics, Caching | Extremely low latency | Limited by RAM capacity|\n",

    "## ## Comparison of Task Execution Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are assigned a **Task X** (e.g., \"Automate Customer Support Ticket Resolution\"), here are the three primary ways to structure the technical approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "### ### 1. Workflow-Based Automation (Deterministic)\n",
    "\n",
    "This uses AI to interpret data, but follows a rigid, linear path (like n8n or Zapier with LLM steps).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Pros:** Highly predictable, easiest to audit/test, lower token costs.\n",
    "* **Cons:** Fails on \"out-of-bounds\" requests; requires manual updates for every new edge case.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ### 2. Single Autonomous Agent (Reasoning Loop)\n",
    "\n",
    "A single LLM equipped with tools (Search, Database, API) that decides the steps to take in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Pros:** Flexible and handles complex, multi-step queries without pre-defined paths.\n",
    "* **Cons:** Higher \"hallucination\" risk; can get stuck in infinite loops; harder to predict cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ### 3. Multi-Agent System (Orchestrated)\n",
    "\n",
    "Different agents are assigned specific roles (e.g., one agent \"Researches,\" another \"Drafts,\" a third \"Reviews\").\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Pros:** Highest accuracy; mimics human departmental structures; compartmentalizes errors.\n",
    "* **Cons:** Highest complexity and latency; most expensive to develop and run.\n",

    "### ### Summary Table: Pros & Cons\n",
